Write if statements to do the following:
a)	 If character variable taxCode is ’TC’, increase price by adding the taxRate percentage if price to it.
b)	 If integer variable opCode has the value 1, read in double values for A and B and calculate and print their sum.
c)	 If integer variable currentNumber is odd, change its value so that it is now 3 times currentNumber plus 1, otherwise change its value so that it is now half of currentNumber (rounded down when currentNumber is odd).
d)	 Assign true to the boolean variable leapYear if the integer variable year is a leap year. (A leap year is a multiple of 4, and if it is a multiple of 100, it must also be a multiple of 400.)
e)	 Assign a value to double variable cost depending on the value of integer variable
distance as follows:
Distance                                                               Cost
-----------------------------------                           ----------
0 through 90                                                     5.00
More than 90 but not more than 300               8.00
More than 300 but less than 9,00                   10.00
900 or more                                                     12.00
